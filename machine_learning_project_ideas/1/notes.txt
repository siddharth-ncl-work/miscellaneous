TASKS:

1. Add 'FG' as a categorical feature

2. Add more features - 3d features, HOMO-LUMO features

 -maybe add features from other library like Mordred

3. Calculate robust model performance using CV

4. Add automatic feature selection using sklearn, manually selecting top 20 features might not be good idea (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html)

5. RFE (Recursive Feture Elimination) to calculate Feature Importance

6. [optional] Add composite Features

7. Feature Selection from multiple methods and models

8. Accuracy wrt FG

9. Performance of top 20 features

# Features


* **SlogP_VSA1 - SlogP_VSA12** - Sum of van der Waals surface area (in Å2) over all atoms such that SlogP is in a specified range [[1](http://www.cadaster.eu/sites/cadaster.eu/files/challenge/descr.htm)]


* **SlogP** - Log of the octanol/water partition coefficient (including implicit hydrogens). This property is an atomic contribution model [[Crippen 1999](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci990307l)] that calculates logP from the given structure; i.e., the correct protonation state (washed structures). Results may vary from the logP(o/w) descriptor. The training set for SlogP was ~7000 structures.


* **fr_NH0** - Number of Tertiary amines


* **fr_NH2** - Number of Primary amines


* **fr_ArN** - Number of N functional groups attached to aromatics


* **fr_aniline** - Number of anilines


* **VSA_EState1 - VSA_EState10** MOE-type descriptors using EState indices and surface area contributions (developed at RD, not described in the CCG paper)[[2](http://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#list-of-available-descriptors)]


* **E-statesindex** - Electrotopological State index for atoms in a molecule. Encode the topology and electronic environment of molecular fragments. This index combines both the electronic character and the topological environment of each skeletal atom in a molecule [[3](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ci00001a012),[4](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224004106_Electrotopological_State_Atom_E-State_Index_in_Drug_Design_QSAR_Property_Prediction_and_Toxicity_Assessment),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6147309/)]


* **HallKierAlpha** - Ratio of non-C(sp3) atom covalent radii to the covalent radius of sp3 carbon summed over all atoms in a molecule [[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470125793.ch9)]


* **Chi(1/2)n** - Atomic connectivity index (order 1/2) in the hydrogen suppressed graph .This is calculated as the sum of 1/sqrt(didj) over all bonds between heavy atoms i and j where i < j. di (number of heavy neighbors)


* **Ipc** - information content of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of a hydrogen-suppressed graph of a molecule


* **Chi3v** - Atomic valence connectivity index (order 3). This is calculated as the sum of 1/sqrt(vivj) over all bonds between heavy atoms i and j where i < j. For a heavy atom i let vi = (pi - hi) / (Zi - pi - 1) where pi is the number of s and p valence electrons of atom i.


* **BertzCT** - A topological index meant to quantify "complexity" of molecules. Consists of a sum of two terms, one representing the complexity of the bonding, the other representing the complexity of the distribution of heteroatoms (from graph theory)


* **Kappa3** - Third kappa shape index: (n-1) (n-3)2 / p32 for odd n, and (n-3) (n-2)2 / p32 for even n. n denotes the number of atoms in the hydrogen suppressed graph. Also, let p2 denote the number of paths of length 2 and p3 the number of paths of length 3


* **PEOE_VSA9** - calculated using partial using partial charges and van der waals surface area contributions of atoms


* **labuteASA** - Water accessible surface area calculated using a radius of 1.4 A for the water molecule. A polyhedral representation is used for each atom in calculating the surface area.


* **SMR_VSA(0-7)** - based on an approximate accessible van der Waals surface area (in Å2) and contribution to Molar Refractivity, summed over all atoms


* **MinAbsPartialCharge** - self-explanatory


* **MaxAbsEStateIndex** - Maximum Absolute Electrotopological State index of molecule


* **balabanJ** - Balaban's connectivity topological index
