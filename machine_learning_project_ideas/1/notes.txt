TASKS:

1. Add 'FG' as a categorical feature

2. Add more features - 3d features, HOMO-LUMO features

 -maybe add features from other library like Mordred

3. Calculate robust model performance using CV

4. Add automatic feature selection using sklearn, manually selecting top 20 features might not be good idea (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html)

5. RFE (Recursive Feture Elimination) to calculate Feature Importance

6. [optional] Add composite Features

7. Feature Selection from multiple methods and models
