REASONS:
1. VERY LARGE ERROR IN THE TRACK ROTATION (ALL METHODS)
2. TRACK IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS RING
3. SO, BETTER IGNORE IT
4. TRASITION STATE THEORY = RELATIVE ENERGY VALUES CANCEL OUT THE ERRORS

AS SIR'S METHOD DEPENDS ON THE TRACK, WE WILL USE MY METHOD FOR ONLY RING ANALYSIS

 *  FOR CASE_2 FIND THE ROTATION OF 
    - A = ONLY RING IN RING+TRACK (SIR'S METHOD) =======(my method)
    - B = ONLY RING (MY METHOD)

 * IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A & B THEN THE TRACK HAS
   INFLUENCE ON THE ROTATION OF THE RING
 
 * we would subtract rotation of only_ring from the ring+track to eliminate systematic errors arising from the method

 * WE CAN GET BETTER ESTIMATION OF DIRECTIONALITY BY TAKING RELATIVE ROTATION (ie A-B), HOPING THAT
   ERROR WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT

 * WE WILL REPEAT THE ABOVE PROCEDURE FOR THE OTHER SYSTEMS AND COMPARE THE DIRECTIONLITY
   BASED ON RELATIVE VALUES

BIG MISTAKE:

CANNOT USE DIFFERENT METHODS TO COMAPRE THE DATA

ONLY 'MY METHOD(AXIS OPT)' SHOULD BE USED FOR THIS STORY
